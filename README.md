# Netflix Movie Analysis üé•üìä

This project analyzes Netflix movie data to explore trends in movie durations over the years and provides visual insights into the dataset. The analysis includes line plots, scatter plots, and filtering techniques to uncover patterns in the data.

## üìå Features

1. **Line Plot of Movie Durations (2011-2020):**  
   Visualizes the trend of average movie durations over the years.
   
2. **Scatter Plot of Movie Durations by Release Year:**  
   Explores the relationship between release year and movie duration.
   
3. **Genre-Based Color Coding:**  
   Highlights specific genres (e.g., Children, Documentaries, Stand-Up) in the scatter plot.
   
4. **Filtering Short Movies:**  
   Identifies movies with durations shorter than 60 minutes.

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**  
   Subsets and inspects key columns like title, country, genre, release year, and duration.

## üìä Visualizations and Insights

### 1. ** Netflix Movie Durations (2011-2020)**

This line plot shows the trend of average movie durations over the years.

```python
plt.plot(durations_df['years'], durations_df['durations'])
plt.title("Netflix Movie Durations 2011-2020")
plt.show()
```
**Insight:**
The average movie duration has decreased slightly over the years, from 103 minutes in 2011 to 90 minutes in 2020.

### 2. ** Movie Duration by Year of Release**

This scatter plot visualizes the duration of individual movies by their release year.

```python
plt.scatter(netflix_movies_col_subset["release_year"], netflix_movies_col_subset["duration"])
plt.title("Movie Duration by Year of Release")
plt.show()
```

**Insight:**
While most movies cluster around 90-120 minutes, there are outliers with much shorter or longer durations.

### 3. ** Short Movies (< 60 Minutes)**
Movies with durations shorter than 60 minutes are filtered and displayed.

```python
short_movies = netflix_movies_col_subset[netflix_movies_col_subset['duration'] < 60]
print(short_movies[0:20])
```

**Insight:**
Short movies are often documentaries or children‚Äôs content.

### 4. **Genre-Based Scatter Plot**
This scatter plot uses color coding to highlight specific genres:

- **Red:** Children
- **Blue:** Documentaries
- **Green:** Stand-Up
- **Black:** Other genres

```python
plt.scatter(netflix_movies_col_subset["release_year"], netflix_movies_col_subset["duration"], c=colors)
plt.title("Movie Duration by Year of Release")
plt.xlabel("Release Year")
plt.ylabel("Duration (min)")
plt.show()
```

**Insight:**
- Children‚Äôs movies tend to have shorter durations.
- Documentaries and Stand-Up specials vary widely in duration.

## üìà Key Findings

- **Are movies getting shorter?**
The trend suggests a slight decrease in average movie duration, but the answer is inconclusive ("maybe").

- **Genre-specific patterns:**
Children‚Äôs movies are consistently shorter, while other genres show more variation.

- **Short movies:**
Movies under 60 minutes are rare and often belong to specific genres like documentaries or children‚Äôs content
